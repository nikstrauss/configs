# Nik's Awesome configs
These arn't like super professional or anything, but I like them.

### bashrc
This is based of the Gentoo defaults, with my own custumizations, like `neofetch` and `fortume-mod`. I also made a ton of aliases that I personaly use.

### vimrc
Just a small nice vim config. Has relative line numbers, and syntax higlighting.

### ranger
All the standard ranger configs, but with some custumization. Has picture previews and removed mouse support.

### oblige
Configs made by me for the Oblige Doom map generator.

### git
Added the git config, pretty basic but with password caching.
